Title: Design and Synthesis of a 32bit pipelined RISC-V processor core
             
Problem Formulation: RISC-V (pronounced “risk-five”) is a new instruction-set architecture (ISA) that was originally designed to support computer architecture research and education.  This ISA was originally conceived at University of California, Berkeley. There are different versions of the ISA supporting 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit architectures. RISC-V supports a number of core instructions and any additional features or instructions can be implemented as needed, thanks to its open source nature. In recent times, this has become a standard-free and open architecture for insudtrial applications. 
This project aims to implement a 32bit five stage pipelined RISC-V processor core. The RTL design is planned to be done in Verilog HDL. The verification programs is to be written in assembly language. The design is tested on Nexys A7 FPGA board.  

Project Objectives:
1. Implement a processor that supports the Base Integer Instruction Set in accordance to the specifications of RISC-V Instruction Set Manual –Volume I: Unprivileged ISA.
2. Improve the speed of the processor by introducing Pipelining.
3. Develop a feasible solution for Data and Control Hazards. 

Project Scope:
The concepts of “Open-source software” and “Open-source hardware” are thriving in the modern society. Hundreds of companies and groups are working hard to provide the humanity with free and open-source software and hardware designs. By working on this project, knowledge on computer architecture, RTL design using Verilog and concepts of simulation and synthesis can be obtained. Lastly, this project will be a contribution to the booming field of Open-source. 

Expected Results: The designed core is expected to operate properly and pass all the verification and testing procedures. It is expected to avoid hazards and provide satisfactory results.
